# eat-Da-Burger

Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM. 

A user inputs the names of burgers they would like to eat, which will then display in a waiting area on the left column. If a user clicks devour, the burger moves over to the devoured column.

The database will store every burger.
